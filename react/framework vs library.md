| **Control** | **You** call the library                     | The **framework** calls **your** code |
| **Freedom** | More flexible, you choose when/how to use it | More structured, it controls the flow |

React is a library:
It gives you functions (useState, useEffect, etc.) and you decide when to use them and how to build your app.

Next.js is a framework built on top of React:
It decides how routing works, where pages go, how to handle server-side rendering, etc. You just fill in the blanks.

 #### Library
You’re in charge.
You call it when you need something.
React is a UI library.


#### Framework
It’s in charge.
You follow its structure.
It uses your code in predefined places.
Examples: Angular, Vue (somewhat), Next.js, Vite (sort of), Laravel (for PHP), Django (for Python).

In code terms:
Using a library (like React) is like saying:
“I’ll write the logic, design the page, and decide how routing or state works — I just need some helpful tools.”
Using a framework (like Next.js or Angular) is like saying:
“You give me a page system, folder structure, and lifecycle — I’ll just put my components and data where you tell me.”
